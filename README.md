This repository houses example scripts written for [_Stipple Effect_](https://github.com/jbunke/stipple-effect). Scripts are written in an extension dialect of my scripting language [_DeltaScript_](https://github.com/jbunke/delta-time/wiki/DeltaScript).

The conventional file extension for _Stipple Effect_ scripts is `.ses`. This is the file mask that the open file dialog will use to identify scripts in the file system.
